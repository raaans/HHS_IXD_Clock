# HHS_IXD_Clock
The clock displays the time (duh), and the background changes depending on the day/night cycle.

If it's between 8 and 20, the earth and sky will appear bright and the sun will move across the sky.

If it's between 20 and 8, the earth and sky will appear dark, stars will appear and the moon will move across the sky.
